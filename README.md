# Development-of-ADRC-for-Mobile-Robot-Using-Interval-Type-2-Fuzzy-Controller
An improved ADRC approach that swaps out the  conventional PD controller with the Interval Type-2 Fuzzy PD  (IT2FPD) controller. Unlike classical PD, the IT2FPD controller  utilizes fuzzy logic to dynamically adjust the proportional gain  based on the systemâ€™s error, allowing for improved adaptability  and disturbance rejection.
